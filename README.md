# Laravel 9 + vue Js
 Laravel + Vue js crud example in its latest versions

# Installation
step into the root folder and Run the following Commands
 
 1. composer install
 2. npm install --save vue@next && npm install --save-dev vue-loader@next
 3. php artisan migrate
 4. php artisan serve
 5. optional run npm run hot

It is important to make sure you have istalled node modules on the root

Since Vue Js works with API calls i also added to the root a postman collection so you can hit the endpoints directly, this is to facilitate your tests.
